# Memory Game Project

The purpose of this project was to create a classic memory card game which flips two card to compare if they match.  If
they do not match the cards flip back to try again. If the cards match, they stay showing the content within the card.  Once the
game is complete a screen will popup to show the amount of moves, the total time, and the number of stars earned.
